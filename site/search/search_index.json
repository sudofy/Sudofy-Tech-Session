This session will also cover little bit about the concept of Generators in javaScript.\n\n\nLinks\n\n\nSlide\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe session is divided into three sections. The first section will cover how event loops and call stack work in JavaScript. The Second section will cover how to write non-blocking and asynchronous code in JavaScript and how to use Promises, call backs and Async-Await effectively and then the last section will cover the concept of Generators in Javascript.\n\n\n\n\nWHY Event Loops and Call Stack ?\n\n\nCall stacks and event loops are very important and it helps you understand how Javascript actually runs on browser and node. It also helps you in understanding how callbacks are actually handled in JavaScript.\n\n\n\n\nWHY Aysnc Await ?\n\n\nES 2017 introduced Asynchronous functions. Async functions are essentially a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code in JavaScript.\n\n\nHere are some important points to remember:\n\n\n\n\nAsync/await is a new way to write asynchronous code.

Intercepts network request and store or retrive data from cache and provide push message to web client even when offline. It doesn't have DOM support and only run on HTTPS.\n\n\nService worker doesn't have access to DOM, so what can we do with JavaScript? Lets discus this.\n\n\nService worker is like a middle man (or middleware) between the webpage and the internet, it handle the network request. When a webpage request the server for HTML, CSS files or any API request it pass through the service worker, it is up to us how we code the service worker to deal with these request like we can send that request to server or we can look for the request in cache if exist then show from cache. It is up to us what approach is better for us to provide a good user experience.\n\n\nBenefits of Offline First\n\n\nBefore service worker, \nAppCache\n was used by the developer to cache data. In \nAppCache\n first network request was made by the site to server and then cache the request when it is completed and whenever the request was failed it was retrive from \nAppCache\n. The drawback of this is, user kept waiting till the network request made or failed which is a bad exprience for the user, so that why \nAppCache\n has been depriciated and \nService Worker\n was introduced on \n08 May, 2014\n.\n\n\nBelow is the image show the working of \nAppCache\n: Referenced from \nUdacity Course\n\n\n\n\nAs \nService Worker\n was introduced, a new approach come into play to develop a web app \nOffline First\n i.e a request to a server is pass through service worker, it will look for data in cache and show the content of the web page that already cache meanwhile gets the respone from the server and show the rest of the content by this approach user wouldn't wait for page to completely load and shouldn't see the white screen all the time. Below the image describe the flow of service worker. Referenced from \nUdacity Course\n\n\n\n\nRegistering a Service Worker\n\n\nTo register a service worker, first we need to check if the service worker is supported by the broswer or not, to do so we need to check for service worker object in \nnavigator\n. \nNavigator\n object contains the information about the user agent and browser.\n\n\nif (navigator.serviceWorker) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then(function(reg) {\n    console.log('Yay!!');\n  }, function(err) {\n    console.log('Boo!!');\n  });\n}\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nsw.js\n is the service worker file located at the root level of project (in my case) it could be of any name and located anywhere inside the project but it is good to have it on root level.\n\n\nLifecycle of Service Worker\n\n\nService worker handle requests to the server. It has a few steps, and to show that I\u2019ll show your a nice picture from \nMDN\n:\n\n\n\nParsed Event\n\n\nWhen we first attempt to register a Service Worker, the user agent parses the script and obtains the entry point. If parsing is successful (and some other requirements, e.g. HTTPS, are met), we will have access to the Service Worker registration object. This contains information about the state of the Service Worker as well as it\u2019s scope.\n\n\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n    navigator.serviceWorker.register('./sw.js')\n    .then(function(registration) {\n        console.log(\nService Worker Registered\n, registration);\n    })\n    .catch(function(err) {\n        console.log(\nService Worker Failed to Register\n, err);\n    })\n}\n\n\n\n\nInstall Event\n\n\nOnce the Service Worker script has been parsed, the user agent attempts to install it and it moves to the installing state. In the Service Worker \nregistration\n object, we can check for this state in the \ninstalling\n child object.\n\n\nnavigator.serviceWorker.register('./sw.js').then(function(registration) {\n  if (registration.installing) {\n      // Service Worker is Installing\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nDuring the installing state, the install event in the Service Worker script is carried out. The \u201cinstall\u201d event is the first event a service worker gets, and it only happens once. A promise passed to \nevent.waitUntil()\n signals the duration and success or failure of your install. A service worker won't receive events like \nfetch\n and \npush\n until it successfully finishes installing and becomes \"active\".\n\n\nBy default, a page's fetches won't go through a service worker unless the page request itself went through a service worker. So you'll need to refresh the page to see the effects of the service worker. An example image shown by \nJake Archibald\n in his \nblog\n:\n\n\n\nTo listen the install event of a service worker, we need to add the following code in our sw.js file:\n\n\nself.addEventListener('install', function(event) {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    // Open cache storage and do something\n  );\n});\n\n\n\n\nInstalled / Waiting\n\n\nIf the installation is successful, the Service Worker moves to the installed (also called waiting) state. In this state it is a valid, but not yet active, worker. It is not yet in control of the document, but rather is waiting to take control from the current worker.\n\n\nIn the Service Worker \nregistration\n object, we can check for this state in the \nwaiting\n child object.\n\n\nnavigator.serviceWorker.register('./sw.js').then(function(registration) {\n  if (registration.waiting) {\n      // Service Worker is Waiting\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nThis can be a good time to notify the app user that they can update to a new version, or automatically update for them.\n\n\nActivate Event\n\n\nAfter the installation of service worker, if there any existing service worker controlling the client, then this worker goes to a \nwaiting\n state. \nThe activate event fires once the old service worker is gone, and your new service worker is able to control clients. This is the ideal time to do stuff that you couldn't do while the old worker was still in use, such as migrating databases and clearing caches.\nThe waiting phase means you're only running one version of your site at once, but if you don't need that feature, you can make your new service worker activate sooner by calling \u201cself.skipWaiting()\u201d. An example image shown by \nJake Archibald\n in his \nblog\n:\n\n\n\nTo listen the activate event of a service worker, we need to add the following code in our sw.js file:\n\n\nself.addEventListener('activate', function(event) {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    // Delete cache\n  );\n});\n\n\n\n\nActivated\n\n\nIf activation is successful, the Service Worker moves to the active state. In this state, it is an active worker in full control of the document. In the Service Worker registration object, we can check for this state in the active child object.\n\n\nnavigator.serviceWorker.register('./sw.js').then(function(registration) {\n  if (registration.active) {\n      // Service Worker is Active\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nWhen a Service Worker is active, it can now handle the functional events - fetch, and message.\n\n\nself.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {\n  // Do stuff with fetch events\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('message', function(event) {\n  // Do stuff with postMessages received from document\n});\n\n\n\n\nRedundant\n\n\nA Service Worker can become redundant for one of the following reasons -\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the installing event failed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the activating event failed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a new Service Worker replaces it as the active service worker\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCacheStorage\n\n\nThe Cache API is a system for storing and retrieving network requests and corresponding responses. The Cache API was created to enable Service Workers to cache network requests so that they can provide appropriate responses even while offline. However, the API can also be used as a general storage mechanism.\n\n\nWhat can be stored?\n\n\nThe caches only store pairs of \u201cRequest\u201d and \u201cResponse\u201d objects, representing HTTP requests and responses. However, the requests and responses can contain any kind of data that can be transferred over HTTP.\nThe API is exposed via the global \u201ccaches\u201d property, so you can test for the presence of the API with a simple feature detection:\n\n\nif('caches' in window) {\n  // HAS SUPPORT!!\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe API can be accessed from a window, iframe, worker, or service worker\n\n\nMethods of CacheStorage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopen(cacheName)\n\n\nReturns a Promise that resolves to the Cache object matching the cacheName (a new cache is created if it doesn\u2019t already exist).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatch()\n\n\nChecks if a given Request is a key in any of the Cache objects that the CacheStorage tracks, and returns a Promise that resolves to that match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhas(cacheName)\n\n\nReturns a Promise that resolves to \u201cTRUE\u201d if a Cache object matching the cacheName exits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkeys()\n\n\nReturns a Promise that will resolve an array containing strings corresponding to all of the named Cache objects tracked by the CacheStorage. Use this method to iterate over a list of all the Cache object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndelete(cacheName)\n\n\nFinds the Cache object matching the cacheName if found, delete the Cache object and returns a Promise that resolves to \u201cTRUE\u201d. If no Cache object is found, it returns \u201cFALSE\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating or opening a cache\n\n\n// \u201ccaches\u201d is a global read-only variable, which is the instance of CacheStorage.\ncaches.open('my-cache').then((cache) =\n { \n  // do something with cache\u2026\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Give your cache names a unique prefix so that it don\u2019t override the other domain cache\nFor ex: \u2018mysite-static-v1\u2019\n\n\n\n\nAdding to cache\n\n\ncaches.open('test-cache').then(function(cache) {\n  cache.addAll(['/', '/images/logo.png'])\n    .then(function() {\n    // Cached!\n    });\n});\ncaches.open('test-cache').then(function(cache) {\n  cache.add('/images/logo.png')\n    .then(function() {\n    // Cached!\n    });\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe addAll method accepts an array of URLs that should be cached, to add single URL, use the add method\n\n\n\n\nput()\n\n\nput() is similar to add() but in, put() we can add response object.\n\n\nfetch('/page/1').then(function(response) {\n  return caches.open('test-cache')\n    .then(function(cache) {\n       return cache.put('/page/1', response);\n    });\n});\n\n\n\n\nRetrieving Cache\n\n\ncaches.open('test-cache').then(function(cache) {\n  cache.keys().then(function(cachedRequests) {\n    console.log(cachedRequests); // [Request, Request]\n  });\n});\n\ncaches.open('test-cache').then(function(cache) {\n  cache.match('/page/1')\n    .then(function(matchedResponse) {\n       console.log(matchedResponse);\n    });\n});\n/*\n Request {\n   bodyUsed: false\n   credentials: \nomit\n\n   headers: Headers\n   integrity: \n\n   method: \nGET\n\n   mode: \nno-cors\n\n   redirect: \nfollow\n\n   referrer: \n\n   url: \nhttps://staging.pitchworthy.co/images/logo.png\n\n}*/\n/*Response {\n   body: (...),\n   bodyUsed: false,\n   headers: Headers,\n   ok: true,\n   status: 200,\n   statusText: \nOK\n,\n   type: \nbasic\n,\n   url: \nhttps://staging.pitchworthy.co/users/me\n\n }\n */\n\n\n\n\n\ncaches.keys\n\n\nTo get the names of existing caches, use \u201ccaches.keys\u201d\n\n\ncaches.keys().then(function(cacheKeys) {\n  console.log(cacheKeys); // ex: [\ntest-cache\n]\n});\n\n\n\n\nDeleting a Cache\n\n\ncaches.delete('test-cache').then(function() {\n  console.log('Cache successfully deleted!');\n});\n\n\n\n\nDelete an old cache and add new one\n\n\nYou often need to delete an old cache and add new one.\n\n\n// Assuming `CACHE_NAME` is the newest name. Time to clean up the old!\nvar CACHE_NAME = 'version-8';\ncaches.keys().then(function(cacheNames) {\n  return Promise.all(\n    cacheNames.map(function(cacheName) {\n      if(cacheName != CACHE_NAME) {\n        return caches.delete(cacheName);\n      }\n    })\n  );\n});",

The \u201cinstall\u201d event is the first event a service worker gets, and it only happens once. A promise passed to  event.waitUntil()  signals the duration and success or failure of your install. A service worker won't receive events like  fetch  and  push  until it successfully finishes installing and becomes \"active\".  By default, a page's fetches won't go through a service worker unless the page request itself went through a service worker. So you'll need to refresh the page to see the effects of the service worker.

Intercepts network request and store or retrive data from cache and provide push message to web client even when offline. It doesn't have DOM support and only run on HTTPS.\n\n\nService worker doesn't have access to DOM, so what can we do with JavaScript? Lets discus this.\n\n\nService worker is like a middle man (or middleware) between the webpage and the internet, it handle the network request. When a webpage request the server for HTML, CSS files or any API request it pass through the service worker, it is up to us how we code the service worker to deal with these request like we can send that request to server or we can look for the request in cache if exist then show from cache. It is up to us what approach is better for us to provide a good user experience.\n\n\nApp Introduction\n\n\nWe have an app called \nWittr\n, it is a real time social networking web app where user share their posts and give comments/feedback on them. This site is fully developed but not a total breakdown on low connectivity and offline mode. So we going to implement the service worker to tackle the blank screen on low connectivity and offline mode.\n\n\nInstalling/Running the App\n\n\nTo install the app on you local machine, you first need to install \nGit\n if you have it that's great. If you dont know about \nGit\n that's not an issue we are just using the basic of \nGit\n. Those who dont know Git, it is a version controlling system.\nTo download or clone the project to your local machine, run command on your terminal or command-line.\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/farazsarwar113/wittr\n\n\nAfter cloning the project run command \nnpm install\n to install all the dependencies required by the project.\nTo run the app run \ngulp serve\n. It will run the app on \nhttp://localhost:8888\n and server on \nhttp://localhost:8889\n.\n\n\nRegistering our first Service Worker\n\n\nWe need to work on only two files throughout the app \npublic/js/sw/index.js\n and \npublic/js/main/IndexController.js\n. This project is configured in a way that when we run command \ngulp serve\n it compiled all the css files in css folder and javascript files in js folder and service worker file in the root of the project with the \nsw.js\n.\n\n\nTo register a service, first we need switch branch.\n\n\ngit reset --hard\n if you have any local changes run this command\n\n\ngit checkout task-register-sw\n\n\nWe will work on \npublic/js/sw/index.js\n inside \n_registerServiceWorker\n function. First we need to check if the service worker is supported by the broswer or not, to do so we need to check for service worker object in \nnavigator\n. \nNavigator\n object contains the information about the user agent and browser.\n\n\nif (!navigator.serviceWorker) return;\nnavigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then(function(reg) {\n  console.log('Registeration successfull');\n}, function(err) {\n  console.log('Error in registeration');\n});\n\n\n\n\nExploring the Dev Tools\n\n\nHijacking Request\n\n\nCustom Response\n\n\nWe can give a custom response to browser request using service worker, to handle the network request we will add a \nEvent Listner\n on \npublic/js/sw/index.js\n.\n\n\nself.addEventListner('fetch', function(event) {\n  event.respondWith(\n    new Response('Hello World')\n  );\n})\n\n\n\n\nThis will be the output we get for any request browser do.\n\n\nself.addEventListner('fetch', function(event) {\n  event.respondWith(\n    new Response('Hello World \nb\n Faraz \n/b\n ')\n  );\n})\n\n\n\n\nWhat if i add the html tag inside my \nHello World\n string. let see.\nIt will render as a string because in the response header the \nContent-Type\n is set to be \nplain/text\n by default, so we set it to \ntext/html\n.\n\n\nself.addEventListner('fetch', function(event) {\n  event.respondWith(\n    new Response('Hello World \nb\n Faraz \n/b\n ', { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }})\n  );\n})\n\n\n\n\nRespond with gif\n\n\nTo get to the position of code done above run:\n\n\ngit reset --hard\n\n\ngit checkout task-customer-response\n\n\nTo respond with gif for the requested url:\n\n\nself.addEventListner('fetch', function(event) {\n  event.respondWith(\n    new Response(\n      fetch('/imgs/devil.gif')\n    )\n  );\n})\n\n\n\n\nThe above code respond every request with gif but that's not the better way, now we respond only the request of img with gif response. To do so \nlog\n event and check for the url and react according to that, let me show how to do that:\n\n\ngit reset --hard\n\n\ngit checkout gif-response\n\n\nself.addEventListner('fetch', function(event) {\n  console.log(event.request.url);\n  if (event.request.url.endsWith('.jpg')) {\n    event.respondWith(\n      new Response(\n        fetch('/imgs/devil.gif')\n      )\n    );\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nHandle 404 and failed state\n\n\nTo handle 404 and failed state we look at then response status:\n\n\nself.addEventListner('fetch', function(event) {\n  event.respondWith(\n    new Response(\n      fetch(event.request.url).then(function(response) {\n        if (response.status === 404) {\n          return new Response('NOT FOUND');\n        }\n      }).catch(function(err) {\n        return new Response('ERROR'); \n      })\n    );\n  );\n})\n\n\n\n\nNow we will show the \ndevil.gif\n to 404 status: To do this first get on the branch\n\ngit reset --hard\n\n\ngit checkout error-handling\n\n\nself.addEventListner('fetch', function(event) {\n  event.respondWith(\n    new Response(\n      fetch(event.request.url).then(function(response) {\n        if (response.status === 404) {\n          return fetch('/imgs/devil.gif')\n        }\n      }).catch(function(err) {\n        return new Response('ERROR'); \n      })\n    );\n  );\n})\n\n\n\n\nCaching and Serving Assets\n\n\nTo cache the static files we have to create cache and add the files on install event of service worker.\n\n\ngit reset --hard\n\n\ngit checkout task-install\n\n\nself.addEventListner('install', function(event) {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    caches.open('wittr-v1').then(function(cache) {\n      cache.addAll([\n        '/',\n        '/style.css',\n        '/main.js'\n      ])\n    })\n  )\n})\n\n\n\n\nNow we cached the data in the CacheStorage, but we request the site we will still be kept waiting. Now we have to check if there is any data in cache we will show it from there otherwise show it from network.\n\n\ngit reset --hard\n\n\ngit checkout task-cache-response\n\n\nself.addEventListner('fetch', function(event) {\n  event.respondWith(\n    caches.match(event.request.url).then(function(response) {\n      if (response) return response;\n      return fetch(event.request)\n    })\n  )\n})\n\n\n\n\nTill now we acheive to show something rather than a blank page or a dinosur but we have still to do alot, we are not getting the updated app or nor doesnt know about the update is here. So now what problems we have to acheive right now:\n\n\n\n\nUnobtrusive app updates\n\n\nGet the user on to the latest version\n\n\nContinously update the cache of posts\n\n\nCache photos\n\n\nCache avatar\n\n\n\n\nUnobtrusive app updates\n\n\nIf we update our css and force reload is checked we can see the changes in browser but if we unchecked the force update and the change the css the broswer doent detch the changes and show the old one because we didnt update the service worker and another service worker is active.\n\n\ngit reset --hard\n\n\ngit checkout task-handling-updates\n\n\nTo deal with this we will delete the old cache on the activate event. \nThe easy step is:\n\n\nself.addEventListner('activate', function(event) {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    caches.delete('wittr-static-v1')\n  )\n})\n\n\n\n\nThe scalable way:\n\n\nvar staticCacheName = 'wittr-static-v2';\n\nself.addEventListner('activate', function(event) {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    Promise.all(\n      caches.keys().then(function(cacheNames){\n        cacheNames.filter(function(cacheName){\n          return cacheName.startWith('wittr-') \n cacheName != staticCacheName;\n        }).map(function(cacheName) {\n          return caches.delete(cacheName)\n        })\n      })\n    )\n  )\n})\n\n\n\n\nTrigger latest version\n\n\nNow we will look at how we will notify user that there is an update ready to install. First we look at the properties and method given by service worker.\n\n\ngit reset --hard\n\n\ngit checkout sw-register-methods\n\n\ngit checkout task-update-notify\n\n\n\nIndexController.prototype._registerServiceWorker = function() {\n  if (!navigator.serviceWorker) return;\n\n  var indexController = this;\n\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then(function(reg) {\n    // TODO: if there's no controller, this page wasn't loaded\n    // via a service worker, so they're looking at the latest version.\n    // In that case, exit early\n    if (!navigator.serviceWorker.controller) return;\n\n    // TODO: if there's an updated worker already waiting, call\n    // indexController._updateReady()\n    if(reg.waiting) {\n      indexController._updateReady()\n      return;\n    }\n    // TODO: if there's an updated worker installing, track its\n    // progress. If it becomes \ninstalled\n, call\n    // indexController._updateReady()\n    if (reg.installing) {\n      indexController._trackInstalling(reg.installing);\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // TODO: otherwise, listen for new installing workers arriving.\n    // If one arrives, track its progress.\n    // If it becomes \ninstalled\n, call\n    // indexController._updateReady()\n    reg.addEventListner('updatefound', function() {\n      indexController._trackInstalling(reg.installing);\n    })\n  });\n};\n\nIndexController.prototype._trackInstalling = function(worker) {\n  var indexController = this;\n  worker.addEventListner('statechange', function() {\n    if (worker.state === 'installed') {\n      indexController._updateReady()\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the above code we can now sent notification to user about the update but how we will trigger the update. let see: First we see some of the methods and properties of service worker.\n\n\nself.skipWaiting()\n is a function to manually tell service worker to active the waiting service worker.\nform the registration object we can emit data to service worker which can be recieve in \nmessage\n event\n\n\nreg.installing.postMessage({ bar: foo })\n;\n\n\nself.addEventListner('message', function(event) {\n  console.log(event.data);\n});\n\n\n\n\nThere is an another event that attached on navigator controller to check if the controller is changed\n\n\nnavigator.serviceWorker.addEventListner('controllerchange', function() {\n  // change happens reload the page\n})\n\n\n\n\nNow we are going to trigger the update with the use of above information\n\n\ngit reset --hard\n\n\ngit checkout task-update-reload\n\n\nIndexController.prototype._updateReady = function(worker) {\n  var toast = this._toastsView.show(\nNew version available\n, {\n    buttons: ['refresh', 'dismiss']\n  });\n\n  toast.answer.then(function(answer) {\n    if (answer != 'refresh') return;\n    // TODO: tell the service worker to skipWaiting\n    worker.postMessage({ action: 'skipWaiting' });\n  });\n};\n\n// in sw/index.js\n\nself.addEventListner('message', function(event) {\n  if (event.data.action === 'skipWaiting') {\n    self.skipWaiting();\n  }\n});\n\n// in indexController.js inside register function\n\nnavigator.serviceWorker.addEventListner('controllerchange', function() {\n  window.location.reload();\n})\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Data using the IndexedDB\n\n\nIntroduction to IndexedDB\n\n\nIn general, there are two different types of databases: relational and document (also known as NoSQL or object). Relational databases like SQL Server, MySQL, and Oracle store sets of data in tables. Document databases like MongoDB, CouchDB, and Redis store sets of data as individual objects. IndexedDB is a document database that exists in a sandboxed context. It contains the object stores, you can create multiple databases with whatever names you choose, but generally there is one database per app.\n\n\nObject store\n\n\nAn object store is an individual bucket to store data. You can think of object stores as being similar to tables in traditional relational databases.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nAn Index is a kind of object store for organizing data in another object store (called the reference object store) by an individual property of the data. The index is used to retrieve records in the object store by this property. For example, if you're storing people, you may want to fetch them later by their name, age, or favorite animal.\n\n\nTransaction\n\n\nA transaction is wrapper around an operation, or group of operations, that ensures database integrity. If one of the actions within a transaction fail, none of them are applied and the database returns to the state it was in before the transaction began. All read or write operations in IndexedDB must be part of a transaction. This allows for atomic read-modify-write operations without worrying about other threads acting on the database at the same time.\n\n\nCursor\n\n\nA mechanism for iterating over multiple records in database.\n\n\nCreate a db\n\n\n//check for support\nif (!('indexedDB' in window)) {\n  console.log('This browser doesn\\'t support IndexedDB');\n  return;\n}\n\nvar dbPromise = idb.open('test-db1', 1);\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Object store\n\n\n//check for support\nif (!('indexedDB' in window)) {\n  console.log('This browser doesn\\'t support IndexedDB');\n  return;\n}\n\nvar dbPromise = idb.open('test-db2', 1, function(upgradeDb) {\n  console.log('making a new object store');\n  if (!upgradeDb.objectStoreNames.contains('firstOS')) {\n    upgradeDb.createObjectStore('firstOS');\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nupgradeDb.createObjectStore('people', {keyPath: 'email'});\n KeyPath is used to define the primary key\n\n\nDefining indexes\n\n\nobjectStore.createIndex('indexName', 'property', options);\n\n\n//check for support\nif (!('indexedDB' in window)) {\n  console.log('This browser doesn\\'t support IndexedDB');\n  return;\n}\n\nvar dbPromise = idb.open('test-db4', 1, function(upgradeDb) {\n  if (!upgradeDb.objectStoreNames.contains('people')) {\n    var peopleOS = upgradeDb.createObjectStore('people', {keyPath: 'email'});\n    peopleOS.createIndex('gender', 'gender', {unique: false});\n    peopleOS.createIndex('username', 'username', {unique: true});\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\ngit checkout task-idb-store\n\n\nfunction openDatabase() {\n  // If the browser doesn't support service worker,\n  // we don't care about having a database\n  if (!navigator.serviceWorker) {\n    return Promise.resolve();\n  }\n\n  return idb.open('wittr', 1, function(upgradeDb) {\n    var store = upgradeDb.createObjectStore('wittrs', {\n      keyPath: 'id'\n    });\n    store.createIndex('by-date', 'time');\n  });\n}\n\nIndexController.prototype._onSocketMessage = function(data) {\n  var messages = JSON.parse(data);\n\n  this._dbPromise.then(function(db) {\n    if (!db) return;\n\n    var tx = db.transaction('wittrs', 'readwrite');\n    var store = tx.objectStore('wittrs');\n    messages.forEach(function(message) {\n      store.put(message);\n    });\n  });\n\n  this._postsView.addPosts(messages);\n};\n\n\n\n\ngit checkout task-show-stored\n\n\nIndexController.prototype._showCachedMessages = function() {\n  var indexController = this;\n\n  return this._dbPromise.then(function(db) {\n    // if we're already showing posts, eg shift-refresh\n    // or the very first load, there's no point fetching\n    // posts from IDB\n    if (!db || indexController._postsView.showingPosts()) return;\n\n    var index = db.transaction('wittrs')\n      .objectStore('wittrs').index('by-date');\n\n    return index.getAll().then(function(messages) {\n      indexController._postsView.addPosts(messages.reverse());\n    });\n  });\n};",

Service worker is like a middle man (or middleware) between the webpage and the internet, it handle the network request. When a webpage request the server for HTML, CSS files or any API request it pass through the service worker, it is up to us how we code the service worker to deal with these request like we can send that request to server or we can look for the request in cache if exist then show from cache.

Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.\n\n\nStop guessing about capacity\n\n\nEliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes\u2019 notice.\n\n\nIncrease speed and agility\n\n\nIn a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.\n\n\nStop spending money running and maintaining data centers\n\n\nFocus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.\n\n\nGo global in minutes\n\n\nEasily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.\n\n\nScaling Infrastructure\n\n\nTraditional Infrastructure\n\n\n\nTraditional Infrastructure is not scale able at all, You can surely provision more and more servers to your data center but its really hard to estimate the server required for a healthy infrastructure. even if you are able to estimate your usage you would end up with a lot of un utilized resources in your data center\n\n\nAWS Infrastructure with auto scaling\n\n\n\nAWS Infrastructure helps you slace in and scale out your servers based on the triggers you specify. In this way you can always provision the right amount of servers to keep your application cool and your customers happy. But getting to this point requires a lot of effort in terms of decoupling your server code and running it in stateless fashion.\n\n\nCloud Computing Service Models\n\n\nIASS\n\n\n\"Infrastructure as a service\" (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests.\n\n\nPAAS\n\n\nPaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a computing platform, typically including operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers.\n\n\nSAAS\n\n\nIn the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is sometimes referred to as \"on-demand software\" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription fee.[69] In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs. This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user's own computers, which simplifies maintenance and support.\n\n\nMBAAS\n\n\nIn the mobile \"backend\" as a service (m) model, also known as backend as a service (BaaS), web app and mobile app developers are provided with a way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud computing services with application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed to their applications and custom software development kits (SDKs). Services include user management, push notifications, integration with social networking services and more.\n\n\nFAAS\n\n\nServerless computing is a cloud computing code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping virtual machines as necessary to serve requests, and requests are billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual machine, per hour. Despite the name, it does not actually involve running code without servers. Serverless computing is so named because the business or person that owns the system does not have to purchase, rent or provision servers or virtual machines for the back-end code to run on.\n\n\nCloud Computing Deployment Models\n\n\n\n\nPrivate cloud\n\n\nPrivate cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally. Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. It can improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities. Self-run data centers are generally capital intensive.\n\n\nPublic cloud\n\n\nA cloud is called a \"public cloud\" when the services are rendered over a network that is open for public use. Public cloud services may be free. Technically there may be little or no difference between public and private cloud architecture, however, security consideration may be substantially different for services (applications, storage, and other resources) that are made available by a service provider for a public audience and when communication is effected over a non-trusted network. Generally, public cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Oracle, Microsoft and Google own and operate the infrastructure at their data center and access is generally via the Internet.\n\n\nHybrid cloud\n\n\nHybrid cloud is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community or public) that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources. Gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers. A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it can't be simply put in one category of private, public, or community cloud service. It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.\n\n\nWhy Choose AWS?\n\n\nAWS pace of innovation\n\n\n\n\nAWS Global Infrastructure\n\n\n\nThe AWS Cloud spans 55 Availability Zones within 18 geographic Regions and 1 Local Region around the world, with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Bahrain, Hong Kong SAR, Sweden, and a second AWS GovCloud Region in the US.\n\n\nHigh Availability Through Multiple Availability Zones\n\n\nUnlike virtually every other technology infrastructure provider, each AWS Region has multiple Availability Zones and data centers. As we\u2019ve learned from running the leading cloud infrastructure technology platform since 2006, customers who care about the availability and performance of their applications want to deploy these applications across multiple Availability Zones in the same region for fault tolerance and low latency. Availability Zones are connected to each other with fast, private fiber-optic networking, enabling you to easily architect applications that automatically fail-over between Availability Zones without interruption.\n\n\nImproving Continuity With Replication Between Regions\n\n\nIn addition to replicating applications and data across multiple data centers in the same Region using Availability Zones, you can also choose to increase redundancy and fault tolerance further by replicating data between geographic Regions. You can do so using both private, high speed networking and public internet connections to provide an additional layer of business continuity, or to provide low latency access across the globe.\n\n\nMeeting Compliance and Data Residency Requirements\n\n\nYou retain complete control and ownership over the region in which your data is physically located, making it easy to meet regional compliance and data residency requirements.\n\n\nGeographic Expansion\n\n\nThe AWS Cloud has announced plans to expand with 12 new Availability Zones in four new geographic Regions: Bahrain, Hong Kong SAR, Sweden, and a second AWS GovCloud Region in the US.\n\n\nScripts for STS\n\n\nInstalling Nginx\n\n\nsudo amazon-linux-extras install -y nginx1.12\nsudo systemctl start nginx\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\n\n\n\nNginx Config\n\n\nserver {\n  listen 80;\n  server_name tutorial;\n  location / {\n    proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;\n    proxy_set_header  Host       $http_host;\n    proxy_pass        http://127.0.0.1:3000;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Apache\n\n\nsudo yum -y install httpd\nsudo service httpd start\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\nsudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\n\n\n\n\nApache Config\n\n\nVirtualHost *:80\n\nServerName errbit.ourcompany.com\nProxyPreserveHost On\nProxyPass / http://localhost:3000/\nProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3000/\n\n/VirtualHost\n \n\n\n\n\nInstalling Node.js with NVM\n\n\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash\n. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh\nnvm install node\n\n\n\n\nIPTables Route\n\n\nsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3000\n\n\n\n\nInstalling git\n\n\nyum install git -y\ngit clone https://github.com/aminahmedkhan/aws-ec2-demo.git\n\n\n\n\nInstalling pm2\n\n\nnpm i -g pm2\npm2 start bin/www\npm2 startup\npm2 save\n\n\n\n\nKill process on port 80\n\n\nsudo kill `sudo lsof -t -i:80`\n\n\n\n\nCPU Stress\n\n\ncat /proc/cpuinfo\nyes \n /dev/null \n\n\n\n\n\nBootstrap script (ec2 user data script)\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\nyum install -y gcc-c++ make -y\ncurl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -\nyum install nodejs -y\nyum install git -y\ngit clone https://github.com/aminahmedkhan/aws-ec2-demo.git\nnpm --prefix aws-ec2-demo i aws-ec2-demo\nsudo node aws-ec2-demo/bin/www",

For example, the word Fr\u00fch (which means \"early\" in German) could be used as a variable name.\n\n\nvar Fr\u00fch = \nfoobar\n;\n\n\n\n\nBut, the variable fr\u00fch is not the same as Fr\u00fch because JavaScript is case sensitive.\n\n\nIn JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).\n\n\nA semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\nThe syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:\n\n\n// a one line comment\n\n/* this is a longer, \n * multi-line comment\n */\n\n/* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */\n\n\n\n\nComments behave like whitespace and are discarded during script execution.\n\n\n\n\nDeclarations\n\n\nThere are three kinds of declarations in JavaScript.\n\n\n\n\nvar\n\n\nlet\n\n\nconst\n\n\n\n\nvar\n\n\nThe var statement declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value. The scope of a variable declared with var is its current execution context.\n\n\nfunction varTest() {\n if (true) {\n   var x = 2;  // scoped whole function!\n   console.log(x);  // 2\n }\n console.log(x);  // 2\n}\n\n\n\n\nlet\n\n\nlet allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. \n\n\nfunction letTest() {\n let x = 1;\n if (true) {\n   let x = 2;  // different variable scoped within if block\n   console.log(x);  // 2\n }\n console.log(x);  // 1\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nconst\n\n\nConstants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let statement. The value of a constant cannot change through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared. \nThe const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value.\n\n\nconst obj = { 'key': 'value' };\nobj = { 'anotherKey': 'value' };  //ERROR\nobj.key = 'otherValue';  //Executes Without Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nYou use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.\n\n\nA JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters \"A\" through \"Z\" (uppercase) and the characters \"a\" through \"z\" (lowercase).\n\n\nYou can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as \u00e5 and \u00fc in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.\n\n\nSome examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.\n\n\nA variable declared using the var or let statement with no assigned value specified has the value of undefined.\n\n\nvar a;\nconsole.log('The value of a is ' + a); // The value of a is undefined\n\nconsole.log('The value of b is ' + b); // The value of b is undefined - see 'Variable hoisting' below to know why\nvar b;\n\nconsole.log('The value of c is ' + c); // Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined\n\nlet x;\nconsole.log('The value of x is ' + x); // The value of x is undefined\n\nconsole.log('The value of y is ' + y); // Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined\nlet y;\n\n\n\n\nVariable Scopes\n\n\nWhen you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.\n\n\nJavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.\n\n\nif (true) {\n  var x = 5;\n}\nconsole.log(x);  // x is 5\n\n\n\n\nThis behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.\n\n\nif (true) {\n  let y = 5;\n}\nconsole.log(y);  // ReferenceError: y is not defined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndefined\n\n\nA variable declared using the var or let statement with no assigned value specified has the value of undefined. The undefined value behaves as false when used in a boolean context.\n\n\nvar input;\nif (input === undefined) {\n doThis();  //This line will execute\n} else {\n doThat();\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull\n\n\nThe value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript primitive values. null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.\n\n\nThe null value behaves as \u20180\u2019 in numeric contexts and as false in boolean contexts.\n\n\nvar n = null;\nconsole.log(n * 32);   // Will log 0 to the console\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Hoisting\n\n\nThe JavaScript engine treats all variable declarations using \u201cvar\u201d as if they are declared at the top of a functional scope or global scope regardless of where the actual declaration occurs. This essentially is \u201choisting\u201d.\nHowever, variables that are hoisted return a value of undefined. So even if you declare and initialize after you use or refer to this variable, it still returns undefined.\n\n\nSo variables might actually be available before their declaration.\n\n\nconsole.log(x); // Undefined\nvar x = 3;  // Using var\nconsole.log(x); // 3\n\n\nconsole.log(y);  // Error\nlet y = 5;  // Using let\nconsole.log(y);  // 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction Hoisting\n\n\nFor functions, only the function declaration gets hoisted to the top and not the function expression.\n\n\n/* Function declaration */\n\nfoo(); // \nbar\n\n\nfunction foo() {\n  console.log('bar');\n}\n\n\n/* Function expression */\n\nbaz(); // TypeError: baz is not a function\n\nvar baz = function() {\n  console.log('bar2');\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript Data Types\n\n\nThe latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:\n\n\nPrimitive:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean\n       true and false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull\n          A special keyword denoting a null value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nundefined\n     A primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\n        integer or floating point number. 42 or 4.326\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString\n        A sequence of characters that represent a text value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\n        (new in ES6) A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand Object.\n\n\nAlthough these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.\n\n\nData type conversion\n\n\nJavaScript is a dynamically typed language. That means you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it, and data types are converted automatically as needed during script execution.\n\n\nvar answer = 42;        //Number\nanswer = 'Thanks for all the fish...'; //Same Variable String\n\n\n\n\nIn expressions involving numeric and string values with the + operator, JavaScript converts numeric values to strings.\n\n\nx = 'The answer is ' + 42 // \nThe answer is 42\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting strings to numbers\n\n\nIn the case that a value representing a number is in memory as a string, there are methods for conversion.\n\n\n\n\nparseInt ( ) :        Only returns whole numbers \n\n\nparseFloat ( ) :  Returns a floating point number.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative method of retrieving a number from a string is with the + (unary plus) operator:\n\n\nx = '2.1' + '4.6' // '2.14.6'\nx = (+'1.1') + (+'1.1') // 2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiterals\n\n\nYou use literals to represent values in JavaScript. These are fixed values, not variables, that you literally provide in your script.\n\n\n\n\nArray Literals\n\n\nBoolean Literals ( true and false )\n\n\nFloating-points Literals\n\n\nIntegers  \n\n\nObject Literals\n\n\nRegEx Literals (Pattern enclosed between slashes:  /ab+c/ )\n\n\nString Literals\n\n\n\n\nArray Literals\n\n\nAn array literal is a list of zero or more expressions, each of which represents an array element, enclosed in square brackets [ ] .\n\n\nvar coffees = ['French Roast', 'Colombian', 'Kona'];\n\n\n\n\nIf you put two commas in a row, the array is created with undefined for the unspecified elements.\n\n\nvar fish = ['Lion', , 'Angel'];       //length = 3\nvar myList = [, 'home', , 'school'];  //length = 4\n\n\n\n\nNumeric Literals\n\n\nIntegers can be expressed in decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8) and binary (base 2).\n\n\n\n\nA leading 0 (zero) on an integer literal, or a leading 0o (or 0O) indicates it is in octal.\n\n\nA leading 0x (or 0X) indicates a hexadecimal integer literal.\n\n\nA leading 0b (or 0B) indicates a binary integer literal.\n\n\n\n\n0, 117 and - 345  (decimal, base 10)\n015, 0001 and - 0o77  (octal, base 8)\n0x1123, 0x00111 and - 0xF1A7  (hexadecimal, \nhex\n or base 16)\n0b11, 0b0011 and - 0b11 (binary, base 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nFloating\n\n\nA floating-point literal can have the following parts:\n\n\n\n\nA decimal integer which can be signed (preceded by \"+\" or \"-\")\n\n\nA decimal point ( \u2018.\u2018 )\n\n\nA fraction (another decimal number)\n\n\nAn exponent.

But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.",
